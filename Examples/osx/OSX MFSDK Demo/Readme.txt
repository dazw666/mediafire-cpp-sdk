This demo is included to demonstrate the proper user of the MediaFire SDK and
to serve as a possible starting point for creating third-party applications.

In order to compile this demo, you will need to first build and install the
SDK which this demo was included with. Afterwards, make sure to set the
project variable BOOST_INSTALL_PREFIX to the path that contains the boost
library and headers and MFSDK_INSTALL_PREFIX to the path that you installed
the SDK to (cmake will install to /usr/local by default).
